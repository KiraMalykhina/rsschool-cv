### About Me 
I was an accountant for five years, then a short time in sales. I really wanted to change my field, find a job that would be interesting for me. Then I bought a course on Udemi the basics of web development and I was interested in this. I want to continue to move in this direction and develop as Frontend Developer.

### Code example  
**from CODEWARS:** Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed.Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.
```
//My decision:
function spinWords(string) {
  let resolt = string.split(' ');
  for (let i = 0; i < resolt.length; i++) {
    if (resolt[i].length >= 5) {
      resolt[i] = resolt[i].split("").reverse().join("");
    }
  }
  return resolt.join(' ').replace(/[^a-z + \s]/gi, '');
}
spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw"
